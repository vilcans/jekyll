Feature: Image tag
  I want to be able to easily add images to my pages and posts

  Scenario: Normal image tag
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% image test.png %}"
    And I have an 30x20 image file "test.png"
    When I run jekyll
    Then I should see "<img src=\"/test.png\" width=\"30\" height=\"20\" />" in "_site/index.html"
    And the _site/test.png file should exist

  Scenario: Shrink image that is wider than threshold
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% image test.png max_width=20 %}"
    And I have an 100x50 image file "test.png"
    When I run jekyll
    Then I should see "<img src=\"/test_20x10.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"10\" />" in "_site/index.html"
    And the _site/test_20x10.png file should exist
    And the _site/test.png file should exist

  Scenario: Shrink image that is taller than threshold
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% image test.png max_height=10 %}"
    And I have an 100x50 image file "test.png"
    When I run jekyll
    Then I should see "<img src=\"/test_20x10.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"10\" />" in "_site/index.html"
    And the _site/test_20x10.png file should exist
    And the _site/test.png file should exist

  Scenario: Use image tag template
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% image test.png max_height=10 %}"
    And I have an 100x50 image file "test.png"
    And I have an _includes directory
    And I have an "_includes/image.html" file that contains "{{image.name}} {{image.width}} {{image.height}} {{original.name}} {{original.width}} {{original.height}}"
    And I have a configuration file with "image_include" set to "image.html"
    When I run jekyll
    Then I should see "/test_20x10.png 20 10 /test.png 100 50" in "_site/index.html"

  Scenario: Absolute image path
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% image /test.png %}"
    And I have an 8x8 image file "test.png"
    When I run jekyll
    Then I should see "<img src=\"/test.png\" width=\"8\" height=\"8\" />" in "_site/index.html"

  Scenario: Default width constraint
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% image test.png %}"
    And I have an 100x50 image file "test.png"
    And I have a configuration file with "image_max_width" set to "20"
    When I run jekyll
    Then I should see "<img src=\"/test_20x10.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"10\" />" in "_site/index.html"

  Scenario: Default height constraint
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% image test.png %}"
    And I have an 100x50 image file "test.png"
    And I have a configuration file with "image_max_height" set to "10"
    When I run jekyll
    Then I should see "<img src=\"/test_20x10.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"10\" />" in "_site/index.html"

  Scenario: Class attribute
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% image test.png class="foo" %}"
    And I have an 8x8 image file "test.png"
    When I run jekyll
    Then I should see "<img src=\"/test.png\" width=\"8\" height=\"8\" class=\"foo\"/>" in "_site/index.html"
